This directory contains self-signed certificate and private key for
testing.

To regenerate them, you can use openssl command:

$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout test-key.pem -out test-cert.pem -days 36500

Set the private key password to 'cafebabe', and
"Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name)" to 'localhost', in order
to run the test script successfully.
