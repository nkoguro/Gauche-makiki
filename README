Gauche-makiki is a simple multithreded http server intended for
applications that wants to provide http server capability easily.
At this moment, the only required file is makiki.scm, so you can
either install it as an ordinary Gauche extension library, or you
can just copy the file into your application.

To use the server, you should define 'http-handler' using
define-http-handler macro:

  (define-http-handler REGEXP PROC)

For each incoming request, the server matches its path of
the request uri against REGEXP, and if it matches, the server
calls PROC with three arguments.

  (proc REQUEST APP-DATA)

REQUEST is a request record.  

    (define-record-type request  %make-request #t
      line                ; the first line of the request
      socket              ; client socket
      remote-addr         ; remote address (sockaddr)
      method              ; request method
      host                ; request host (not filled in the current version yet)
      path                ; request path
      path-rxmatch        ; #<rxmatch> object of matched path
      query               ; unparsed query string
      params              ; query parameters
      headers             ; request headers
      (status)            ; result status (set later)
      (response-headers)  ; response headers (set later) (not used yet)
      (response-size))    ; size of reply content in octets (set later)

APP-DATA is an application-specific data given at the time the server
is started.

PROC should call either respond/ok or respond/ng at the tail
position.   NB: These must be extended greatly to support various
types of replies.

  (respond/ok REQ BODY)   ; BODY can be <string>, (file <filename>),
                          ;   (plain <lisp-object>), (json <alist>),
                          ;   or text-tree (cf. text.tree)
  (respond/ng REQ CODE)

For the convenience, file-handler can be used to create a handler
procedure suitable for define-http-handler to return a file
on the server.

  (file-handler :key directory-index)


Finally, to start the server, call start-http-server.

  (start-http-server :key host port document-root num-threads max-backlog
                          access-log error-log app-data)
